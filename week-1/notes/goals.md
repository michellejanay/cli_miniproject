# Mini Project Week 1

In this week we'll be building out the foundation of your app, in particular, the UI aspect.
This will make use of your ability to print to the screen, clear the screen, accept user input, and create a basic `list` data structure.

Try to make good use of functions for repetitive tasks.

## Goals

As a user I want to:

- create a product and add it to a list
- view all products
- _STRETCH_ update or delete a product
