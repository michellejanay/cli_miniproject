# Mini Project Week 4

Now that we've learned how to work with two-dimensional data, let's refactor our app to use dictionaries for both product and courier.

Building upon our use of a courier index within our order, let's create a list of product indexes now for order items.

We'll also need to refactor our storage layer to use `.csv` files rather than `.txt` to bring back our persistence functionality.

To show that our code works, we will also need to write unit tests to prove that our app works correctly.

## Goals

As a user I want to:

- create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
- view all products, couriers, or orders
- update the status of an order
- persist my data
- _STRETCH_ update or delete a product, order, or courier
- _BONUS_ list orders by status or courier

## Spec

- A `product` should be a `dict`, i.e:

```json
{
  "name": "Coke Zero",
  "price": 0.8 // Float
}
```

- A `courier` should be a `dict`, i.e:

```json
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "phone": "0789887889"
}
```

- An `order` should be a `dict`, i.e:

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John",
  "customer_address": "Unit 2, 12 Main Street, LONDON, WH1 2ER",
  "customer_phone": "0789887334",
  "courier": 2, // Courier index
  "status": "preparing",
  "items": "1, 3, 4" // Product index
}
```

- Data should be persisted to a `.csv` file on a new line for each `courier`, `order`, or `product`, ie:

```csv
# ORDER
John,"Unit 2, 12 Main Street, LONDON, WH1 2ER",2,preparing,"1,3,4"
```

## Pseudo Code

```txt
LOAD products from products.csv    
LOAD couriers from couriers.csv
